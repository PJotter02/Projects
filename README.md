## About

This repository is intended for potential employers and colleagues who are interested in reviewing my work in cybersecurity. Each project is documented with a detailed description, the technologies used, and instructions on how to run and use the tools and scripts provided.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Network Security Monitoring

**Description**: This project involves setting up a network security monitoring system using tools such as Wireshark, Snort, and Suricata. The goal is to detect and analyze malicious traffic in a simulated network environment.

- **Technologies Used**: Wireshark, Snort, Suricata, Python
- **Key Skills Demonstrated**: Network traffic analysis, IDS/IPS configuration, packet sniffing

### Project 2: Vulnerability Assessment Tool

**Description**: Developed a custom vulnerability assessment tool that scans a network for common vulnerabilities. This tool automates the process of identifying weak points within a network and provides a report with remediation suggestions.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Nmap, OpenVAS
- **Key Skills Demonstrated**: Scripting, network scanning, vulnerability management

### Project 3: Incident Response Plan

**Description**: Created a comprehensive incident response plan for a simulated corporate environment. The plan includes procedures for detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents.

- **Technologies Used**: Documentation tools (Markdown, LaTeX)
- **Key Skills Demonstrated**: Incident response planning, risk assessment, policy writing
